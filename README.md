### Requeriments
-- GNU/Linux Operating System

### Installation
Simply clone this repository and run the following script on the terminal using:

```sh sigmaupgrade.sh```

### Documentation

 - I've created this script because I was traveling and my internal hard
   drive broke 
 - And I was forced to create a Linux Live ISO
 - But since everything was lost upon restart,
 - I've created this customization script to add to my DOT files

 


### How it works

 1. Asks you if you are running the script through a Live ISO
 2. Searchs for your OS to use your package manager 
 3. Installs Z Shell
 4. Installs recommended fonts automatically 
 5. Installs the configuration I think it's the best one 
 -- You can change that by running the configuration wizard to your own
 6. Makes Z Shell your default shell by changing the exec on your bashrc
